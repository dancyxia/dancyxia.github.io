### Close of the office
**Finally the office is closed**. People asked me how I felt. I don't know how to answer. It's just complicated. A little relief? a little lost? Maybe a little happiness. I decide not to make a hurry search on jobs. During the past two decades, I was always running for various new technologies, trying different areas of development. Now it was time to take a break, enjoy some good readings, reflect on the work I have done and then get a new start!

Now one week has passed. It went better than I expected. In the first day, I finished chapter 5 of "The algorithm design manual". Also I got an idea. I would continue go for mobile app development job, either as a freelancer or work for a company. Why not start from showing my development passion and the understanding of algorithms through github? I decided to develop an android application to demo the data structure of Graph and its related algorithms. At the same time, I would record the development process and publish it to the github.

### Demo App for Graph Related Algorithms

This application is based on the graph algorithms that I read the other day. The intention is simple. It is just to help memorize the Graph data structure and consolidate my understanding of the algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Loop detection, and etc. Also it should help to refresh my knowledge on the android API's manipulation. So I define the scope of the first week's work is to implement a simple Graph generator. The major functions are as follows:

* As the generator, it can produce several vertexes. The vertexes are randomly distributed on the canvas. 
* The vertex number is configurable. 
* The shape and the colour of the vertex is flexible. 
* The edges are added by the user through dragging between two vertexes. 

### A few words about jekyll

Thanks to google, github and the selfless authors who wrote the useful guides. Because of them I can have published the blog fast. 

BTW, I took some time to figuarre out how to get my github information, such as avatar link, my id.... It can be retrieved with [this](https://api.github.com/users/swingseagull) link
