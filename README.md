# Read Me

I created this blog to record my online development life. The blog is based on Jekyll. I referred to many templates for the design. I'd specially thank [Gaohaoyang](https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io). I learned many skill and got some idea by studying his theme. Actually I refactored my originally blog based on his theme.
