**purpose**: 

Login with username/password is tedious. And sometimes you want to automate your SSH tasks, i.e, in a shell script. You don\'t want to enter the password everytime. OpenSSH provides another way for the authentication without having to input password

For example, you want to SSH hostb from hosta. Here\'s what you want to do for this purpose.

**Step 1:  Create public and private key pair**

Run ssh-keygen at hosta

{% highlight bash linenos %}

	jsmith@hosta$ [Note: You are on hosta here]
	jsmith@hosta$ ssh-keygen
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa):[Enter key]
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter key]
	Enter same passphrase again: [Pess enter key]
	Your identification has been saved in /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	33:b3:fe:af:95:95:18:11:31:d5:de:96:2f:f2:35:f9 jsmith@hosta
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 2:  Copy the public key to hostb using ssh-copy-id**

{% highlight bash linenos %}

	jsmith@hosta$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub hostb
	jsmith@hostb's password:

{% endhighlight %}

Now try logging into the hostb box, with "ssh 'hostb'", and check in:

.ssh/authorized_keys

you will find the content of id_rsa.pub is already appended to .ssh/authorized_keys

**Step 3:  Login**

Now you can login to hostb from hosta without password
	{% highlight bash linenos %}

	jsmith@hosta$ ssh hostb
	Last login: Sun Nov 16 17:22:33 2008 from 192.168.1.2
	[Note: SSH did not ask for password.]

	jsmith@hostb$ [Note: You are on hostb here]

{%  endhighlight  %}

**Config**

If you want to login with a different account or use an alias. You can do it by adding host info to .ssh/config.
	{% highlight bash linenos %}
	Host hostbalias
		HostName hostb
		User root
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
		StrictHostKeyChecking no
	{% endhighlight %}

Then you can login to hostb with root account.
{% highlight bash linenos %}

	jsmith@hosta$ ssh hostbalias
	Last login: Sun Nov 16 17:22:33 2008 from 192.168.1.2
	root@hostb# [Note: You are on hostb here with root account]
{% endhighlight %}
